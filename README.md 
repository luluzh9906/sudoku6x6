# 6x6 Sudoku — Mini (English)

A lightweight 6×6 Sudoku web game (PWA) — ready to deploy on GitHub Pages.

## Features
- 6×6 grid with 3×2 boxes
- Puzzle generator & backtracking solver
- Difficulty: Easy / Medium / Hard
- Note mode, hints, erase, keyboard support
- Timer and mistake counter
- Installable as PWA (manifest + service worker)
- Responsive for mobile & desktop

## How to run locally
1. Clone the repo.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser (for service-worker to work use a static server).
   - Simple local server: `npx http-server` or `python -m http.server 8000`.
3. Enjoy!

## Deploy to GitHub Pages
1. Create a new repository on GitHub and push all files.
2. In repository settings -> Pages -> choose branch `main` (or `gh-pages`) and `/ (root)`.
3. After a minute your site will be live.
4. The PWA install prompt will appear on supported browsers (Chrome/Edge/Firefox Android).

## Notes & Future Improvements
- Current `carvePuzzle` ensures solvability but does not guarantee uniqueness. To enforce uniqueness, integrate a solver that counts solutions after each removal (slower).
- If you want strict unique-solution puzzles, I can provide a `countSolutions` variant and integrate it (tradeoff: generation speed).
- UI polish suggestions: add animations, better mobile layout, undo/redo, shareable puzzle link.
